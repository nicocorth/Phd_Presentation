The physical model addresses non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects in plasmas through a multi-temperature model formulation. Fluid governing equations are spatially discretized using a cell-centered finite volume method and are tightly coupled to the electromagnetic and radiative transfer equations required for modeling external fields and radiation transfer. The electromagnetic (EM) equations are numerically solved with a mixed finite-element solver capable of handling both time-dependent and frequencydomain Maxwell’s equations, while the radiation transport equation is discretized using a finite volume-based method. The problem under investigation involves the flow within the CHESS Plasmatron X facility, the country’s largest ICP plasma wind tunnel. The analysis focuses on the flow within the torch used for plasma generation. Findings from the investigation reveal that the effect of radiation transport becomes necessary for pressures exceeding 5 kPa. }

This introduction to magnetohydrodynamics brings together the theory of plasma behavior with advanced topics including the applications of plasma physics to thermonuclear fusion and plasma- astrophysics. Topics covered include streaming and toroidal plasmas, nonlinear dynamics, modern computational techniques, incompressible plasma turbulence and extreme transonic and relativistic plasma flows. The numerical techniques needed to apply magnetohydrodynamics are explained, allowing the reader to move from theory to application and exploit the latest algorithmic advances. Bringing together two previous volumes: Principles of Magnetohydrodynamics and Advanced Magnetohydrodynamics, and completely updated with new examples, insights and applications, this volume constitutes a comprehensive reference for students and researchers interested in plasma physics, astrophysics and thermonuclear fusion.},

A general construction of the AUSM+ scheme is layed out and then focus is on the analysis of the a scheme and its mathematical properties, heretofore unreported. Monotonicity and positivity are proved, and a CFL-like condition is given for first and second order schemes and for generalized curvilinear co-ordinates.

abstract = {We present and analyze detailed numerical simulations of high-pressure inductively coupled air plasma flows using two different mathematical formulations: an extended chemical nonequilibrium formalism including finite-rate chemistry and a form of the equations valid in the limit of local thermodynamic equilibrium and accounting for the demixing of chemical elements. Simulations at various operating pressures indicate that significant demixing of oxygen and nitrogen elements occurs, regardless of the degree of nonequilibrium in the plasma. Ideally, this effect should therefore be taken into account when processing the results of tests of thermal protection materials for (re-)entry spacecraft in inductively coupled plasma wind tunnels. As the operating pressure is increased, chemistry becomes increasingly fast and the nonequilibrium results correctly approach the results obtained assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium, supporting the validity of the proposed local equilibrium formulation. {\textcopyright} 2004 by the authors.},

The induction coil is taken into account in its actual 3D shape, showing the effects on the plasma discharge of removing the axisymmetric hypothesis of simplification, which characterizes 2D approaches. Steady flow and energy equations are solved for optically thin argon plasmas under the assumptions of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and laminar flow. The electromagnetic field equations are solved on an extended grid in the vector potential form. In order to evaluate the importance of various 3D effects on calculated plasma temperature and velocity fields, comparisons of our new results with the ones obtainable from 2D models and from an improved 2D model that includes 3D coil effects are presented. 3D results are shown for torches working under various geometric and operating conditions and with different coil shapes, including conventional helicoidal, as well as planar, elliptical, and double-stage configurations. {\textcopyright} 2005 IUPAC.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present ideas and procedure to extend the AUSM-family schemes to solve flows at all speed regimes. To achieve this, we first focus on the theoretical development for the low Mach number limit. Specifically, we employ asymptotic analysis to formally derive proper scalings for the numerical fluxes in the limit of small Mach number. The resulting new scheme is shown to be simple and remarkably improved from previous schemes in robustness and accuracy. The convergence rate is shown to be independent of Mach number in the low Mach number regime up to M∞ = 0.5, and it is also essentially constant in the transonic and supersonic regimes. Contrary to previous findings, the solution remains stable, even if no local preconditioning matrix is included in the time derivative term, albeit a different convergence history may occur. Moreover, the new scheme is demonstrated to be accurate against analytical and experimental results. In summary, the new scheme, named AUSM+-up, improves over previous versions and eradicates fails found therein. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{VandenAbeele2000,
abstract = {A new approach to the numerical modeling of high-pressure inductive plasmas is presented. The governing magnetohydrodynamic equations are discretized in a second-order accurate finite volume manner. A pressure-stabilized flowfield solver is introduced as an alternative to the staggered-mesh solvers used in traditional algorithms. It is argued that the widely used integral boundary formulation for the electric field is computationally expensive and cannot be incorporated into an efficient iterative solution procedure. A far-field formulation of the electric field is adopted instead, such that state-of-the-art iterative methods can be applied to speed up the calculation. The discretized equations are solved through a damped Picard method and an approximate and a full Newton method. Efficient linear algebra methods are used to solve the linear systems arising from the iterative methods. An appropriate linearization of the (strongly positive) joule heating source term is found to be important for the convergence at the linear level. The new model is tested on a 3-species argon and an 11-species air inductive plasma computation. The proposed damped Picard iterative method is found to be very robust during the initial iterations, but does not converge well thereafter. The approximate Newton method converges substantially better. Finally, the full Newton method yields rapid quadratic convergence rates at the expense of an increase in storage. Taking into account both speed of convergence and memory use, the approximate Newton method is considered to be optimal.},

abstract = {The VKI Plasmatron is the world's largest inductively coupled plasma facility, which allows to reproduce on ground the high-enthalpy, chemically reacting boundary layer over a re-entry body. Test conditions are suitable for qualification of thermal protection systems and for material response studies. This paper presents the experimental investigation of the free-stream air plasma flow under relevant test conditions and the comparison to numerical simulations of the plasma discharge in the test chamber. Previous works have already focused on a similar subject; however, high-resolution spectra over a broad wavelength range, spectral fitting to absolute emission intensities and comparison of experimental temperatures with CFD simulations of the plasma jet were never performed on this facility. Here, the gas-phase radiative signature of dominant atomic and molecular species is observed using a high-resolution spectrograph, combined with a two-dimensional ICCD array. From the rebuilding of local emission intensities, obtained through Abel inversion, radial temperature profiles are determined under the assumption of Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium (LTE). The procedure is based either on fitting the experimental spectra with a line-by-line code (Specair) or by analytical results assuming a Boltzmann's distribution. The simulated spectra, computed with equilibrium chemical composition and a one-temperature model, agree with the experimental data. Magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the plasma jet are then performed using an in-house code and temperature profiles are compared with the experimental gas temperatures at the corresponding locations. Once the power efficiency parameter of the simulation is adequately adjusted, a noticeable agreement is found in the radial distributions at each axial position.},

@article{Zhang2016,
abstract = {This work addresses the modeling of non-equilibrium phenomena in inductively coupled plasma discharges. In the proposed computational model, the electromagnetic induction equation is solved together with the set of Navier-Stokes equations in order to compute the electromagnetic and flow fields, accounting for their mutual interaction. Semi-classical statistical thermodynamics is used to determine the plasma thermodynamic properties, while transport properties are obtained from kinetic principles, with the method of Chapman and Enskog. Particle ambipolar diffusive fluxes are found by solving the Stefan-Maxwell equations with a simple iterative method. Two physico-mathematical formulations are used to model the chemical reaction processes: (1) A Local Thermodynamics Equilibrium (LTE) formulation and (2) a thermo-chemical non-equilibrium (TCNEQ) formulation. In the TCNEQ model, thermal non-equilibrium between the translational energy mode of the gas and the vibrational energy mode of individual molecules is accounted for. The electronic states of the chemical species are assumed in equilibrium with the vibrational temperature, whereas the rotational energy mode is assumed to be equilibrated with translation. Three different physical models are used to account for the coupling of chemistry and energy transfer processes. Numerical simulations obtained with the LTE and TCNEQ formulations are used to characterize the extent of non-equilibrium of the flow inside the Plasmatron facility at the von Karman Institute. Each model was tested using different kinetic mechanisms to assess the sensitivity of the results to variations in the reaction parameters. A comparison of temperatures and composition profiles at the outlet of the torch demonstrates that the flow is in non-equilibrium for operating conditions characterized by pressures below 30 000 Pa, frequency 0.37 MHz, input power 80 kW, and mass flow 8 g/s.},
